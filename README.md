### Mod Choice Notes

* *QoL Research:* I have a feeling I'm going to want this, even if the techs are really expensive.
* *Alien Biomes:* I like the asthetic elements of this, and I think it would compliment the notion of pyAL. This is
  slightly game changing, however, in that it generates a lot more rocks and trees, making the early game a tad easier
  for stone, logs, moss, and sap.
* *Deadlock's Compact Loaders:* Redux Loaders are absurdly expensive, so while I prefer them over Deadlock, they're
  out.
* *Mega Bot Start:* I can't stand manually placing pipes or weaving belts anymore. I don't miss that part of the early
  game experience.
* *Even Distribution* and *Far Reach* will be uninstalled after the early game, as they're just there for my sanity.
* *Someone's Lua Console:* I don't intend to use this in the main playthrough, but I have needed it in various mod play
  throughs to address bugs, so I'd rather just have it available in case I need it.
* *Ore Eraser:* Game changing only in that some resources may not be otherwise eligible to build atop of.
